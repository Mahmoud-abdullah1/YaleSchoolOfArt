                  A sculpture exhibited as part of the thesis presentation by Nic[o] Brierre Aziz, Sculpture MFA ‘25, first installed in March, is officially on loan to the Yale School of Art as a public artwork. Situated between 1156 Chapel Street and York Street Noodle House, Aziz’s sculptural intervention, entitled <em>Affectionate Atrophy (Hire Goals)</em>, involves two black netless basketball hoops fixed to a tree and connected by seven interlocking black metal rings.

                <p>
                  During his thesis show, <em>A Jazz Funeral For William Wells Brown</em>, the artist utilized the sculpture as part of a performance that began by shooting donut holes like basketballs through the top-most hoop before processing down to the work’s double inside the basement of Green Hall Gallery. This work is on view through December 5 as part of the artist’s solo exhibition, <em>Time to Make the Donuts</em>, at Space One Eleven in Birmingham, Alabama.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Connecting Birmingham and New Haven through his (Hire Goals) sculptures, Aziz weaves together themes of land, labor, and ritual in seemingly disparate places but with shared histories of oppression and resistance through play. "I believe that play and satire are powerful antidotes to the toxins that histories of colonialism have left amongst us all,” Aziz shared.
