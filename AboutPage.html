<p class="School_Description">The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers Master of Fine Arts Degrees in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture.</p>
<p class="School_Description">Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are provided an educational context in which they can explore the potential of their own talents in the midst of an intense critical dialogue. This dialogue is generated by their peers, by distinguished visitors, and by a faculty comprised of professional artists of acknowledged accomplishment.</p>
<p class="School_Description">The graduate student's primary educational experience at Yale is centered on the student's own studio activity. Supporting this enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from rigorous, structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and the rich academic offerings found throughout Yale.</p>
<p class="School_Description">The School of Art offers an undergraduate art major for students in Yale College. Students from other departments may enroll in elective courses with permission.</p>
